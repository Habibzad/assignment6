# Simple Banking App

The banking app is a secure and user-friendly financial platform built with Spring Boot, Spring JDBC, Spring Security, and Slf4j for logging, and backed by a PostgreSQL database. It offers a range of essential features, including account creation, money transfers between accounts, and access to various Certificate of Deposit (CD) offerings. The system includes distinct user roles: regular account holders and admin users. Regular users can create accounts, transfer money, and view their own account details, ensuring a personalized banking experience. Admin users, on the other hand, possess elevated privileges, enabling them to close accounts, create new users, and manage accounts and account holders. The application emphasizes robust security measures, employing Spring Security for authentication and authorization, safeguarding user data and transactions.
## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot:** Provides a robust framework for building Java-based applications with minimal configuration.
- **Spring JDBC:** Simplifies database operations and eliminates the need for manual connection management.
- **Spring Security:** Offers authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure endpoints and resources.

## Database
The application uses **PostgreSQL** as the database management system to store account information and other relevant data.

## Functionality and Endpoints

## Security

- **User Authentication:** The application uses Spring Security to authenticate users.
    - **POST `/login`**: Users can authenticate by providing their credentials in the payload. For instance, an admin user can authenticate with the following payload:

        ```json
        {
          "username": "admin",
          "password": "admin"
        }
        ```
- **User Authorization:** Admin users have elevated privileges to manage accounts and users, while regular account holders can only view their own information.
